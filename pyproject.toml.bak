# TOML files will be phasing out setup.py as the de facto way to
# install packages. I've included it here as reference/reminder for
# future. It currently can be installed with the TOML file via poetry.
# The current drawback with pyproject.toml is that it does not allow
# for pip install in editable mode.
# To install via poetry, rename pyproject.toml.bak to remove .bak
# and move setup.py to setup.py.bak (so that pip won't find it).
